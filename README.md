## About

The GitHub integration for Slack/Teams gives you and your teams full visibility
into your GitHub projects right in Slack/Teams channels, where you can generate
ideas, triage issues and collaborate with other teams to move projects forward. 

This includes getting notifications on Slack/Teams about the things that
happens on your subscribed repositories and also scheduled reminders.
